            <p>When touching an object, you can rapidly displace or add energy to it. For example, producing a fireball by holding a lit flame and rapidly adding heat energy to it, or rapidly taking away gravitational potential energy from an object, preventing it from falling momentarily as it gathers it's potential energy again. This technique is heavily <mark>SP</mark> intensive, costing <code>6SP</code> per <mark>6</mark> seconds a technique is active.

              As a bonus action, you can add red into ONE INSTANCE of the effect of a spell or a cantrip that you cast in the same turn. (Ala, scorching ray is 3 rays, but only 1 ray has red). When using red, the spell or cantrip will target the enemy using it's <mark>Spirit Defense</mark> stat rather than its <mark>Armor Class</mark> if it's an attack roll. Red also allows the spell or cantrip to ignore cover and line of sight, as well as extending the range of the ability by <code>30ft</code>. By expending another <code>3SP</code> for a total of <code>9SP</code>, you can enhance the effect of red on the spell/cantrip and deal an additional <code>d10</code> damage, and you can change the damage type of the ray to any damage type (except true).

              As a bonus action, you can add blue into ONE INSTANCE of the effect of a spell or a cantrip that you cast in the same turn. (Ala, scorching ray is 3 rays, but only 1 ray has red). When using blue, you are able to delay the casting and activation of spells and cantrips, storing the spell and cantrip within an item, surface, object or materialise the spell/cantrip as a barely physical blue orb. The spell will automatically trigger when the object or surface is destroyed, and if not, they are automatically casted at the start of your next turn.
